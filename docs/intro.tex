\builder~is a web application focused on developing process-driven applications using the \engine.
\engine~provides a platform that allows you to model and automate business processes as a sequence of tasks performed
in accordance with defined rules, integrate tasks from existing applications into processes, while digitizing "paper"
tasks with the need to program only to the extent necessary.

Workflow processes are implemented within Netgrif AE using the so-called workflow nets that consist of state variables,
tasks and their interconnections.
Workflow nets determine where individual tasks can be performed.

Reports of enabled tasks and processed tasks can be displayed in different forms according to customer requirements,
for example in the form of graphs or tables.
After choosing a Dashboard task type, the user will be able to access a list of tasks of the type in the Task Manager screen.

Individual tasks in Task Manager can be assigned to users based on predefined roles (delegate).
Upon assignment, the status of the task changes from the enabled state to the assigned state.
The assigned task can be canceled or moved to another user with the same rights (reassign).

The application allows using customized filtering to create personalized task lists.
Personalized task lists can be created by the user himself or created by a supervisor.
In user management, it is possible to assign specific users to roles and groups within the customer's organizational structure.
